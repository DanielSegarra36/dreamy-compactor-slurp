        <h2>display: in-line;</h2>
        <p>
          Inline items do not generate line breaks before or after themselves.
          In normal flow, the next element will be on the same line if there
          is space

          this is a block display. it takes up this entire block of space. no

      <h1>POSITIONING ELEMENTS</h1>
      <section class="position-static-section">
        <h2>position: static;</h2>
        <div class="position-static box">
          This uses static positioning. This means that the element cannot be
          repositioned. Its position is dictated by the flow of the document.
          Where it is is where it is.
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="position-relative-section">
        <h2>position: relative;</h2>
        <div class="position-relative box">
          Relative positioning means the element will be positioned in
          relation to its natural position within the document.<br />You can
          use top/bottom/left/right CSS rules to move an item all around.<br />Notice
          this container is 50% from the left and -50px from the top (meaning
          this goes above its natural place in the document)
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="position-fixed-section">
        <h2>position: fixed;</h2>
        <div>THE FIXED EXAMPLE IS AT THE
          <div class="fixed-style box">BOTTOM RIGHT</div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Fixed content is pinned to a coordinate on the view window. So if
          you give a fixed element a bottom of -10px then that item will
          always be pinned to the bottom view with 10px of the content just
          below the view window
        </p>
        <div class="position-fixed box fixed-style" id="fixed-container">
          this is fixed to one position
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="position-sticky-section">
        <h2>position: sticky;</h2>
        <p>
          This is commonly used for navigation menus but can be used anywhere an item needs to stick. Notice the difference in behavior between sticky and fixed. Sticky items scroll/flow into their position whereas fixed items are always pinned to their position.
        </p>
        <div class="position-sticky box">
          This will stick to the given position once it reaches it. Notice how
          this element scrolls in and then sticks once it reaches the location specified in the CSS.
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="position-absolute">
        <section class="position-absolute-relative-to-container">
          <h2>position: absolute;</h2>
          <h3>Absolute Positioning within a Container</h3>
          <div class="parent box">
            <p>
              Use the CSS rules for "child" to see how absolute positioning
              removes an element from the flow and pins it to a pixel
              coordinate. There are extra rules written to demonstrate where the box can be placed.
            </p>

        <section>
          <h3 id="position-absolute-relative-to-body">Absolute Positioning with No Parent Container</h3>
          <p>
            If an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it
            uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling. It is
            positioned within the initial view window. Therefore bottom: 0px; is
            not the bottom of the

          <h2>Realistic Use Case of Absolute Positioning</h2>
          <p>
            Absolute positioning is usually used for artistic purposes. Such as
            overlapping objects for visual appeal. It is not however recommended
            to use for entire page layouts. Doing so will pin elements to pixel
            coordinates on the screen. Therefore on smaller screens your content
            will get cut off and not resize.
